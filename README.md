Oam uploader

## Overview

## Gulp for building
The gulpfile is based on the [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) yeoman generator. The build system currently supports:

- Image optimization
- Sass compilation
- Watchify for JS bundling
- Minification/uglification where appropriate
- Serving and live reloading of pages

There are two commands, both run via npm.

- `npm run build` or `gulp build` or `gulp` - clean & build everything and put it into dist folder
- `npm run serve` or `gulp serve` - serve the pages and utilize live reload on changes to styles, fonts, images, scripts and HTML.
